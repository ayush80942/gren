# ðŸŒ³ GREN - Making Lifestyle Sustainable ðŸŒŽ

## ðŸ’¡Inspiration

_Stat:_ <br/>
ðŸ‘‰ Mother nature is already taking hits from the poor choices of us human beings where we leave behind Carbon Footprints from the food we consume to the Toilet paper we use. <br/>
ðŸ‘‰ Do you know? Just one liter of Coke costs us **346 gm** of Carbon Dioxide from manufacture to our refrigerator and Mega roll of Ultra Smooth Toilet paper leaves **771 gm** CO2â€¦ Yes! Twice than Coke. <br/>
<br/>
_Survey:_ <br/>
ðŸ‘‰ Figures like these ignited curiosity and got us thinking if Big MNCs are adopting low Carbon goods then why canâ€™t we? <br/>
ðŸ‘‰ On doing a quick local survey we found out 7 in 10 people didnâ€™t know about alternatives at all or where to buy them. <br/>
<br/>
_Approach:_ <br/>
ðŸ‘‰ So we Solved this exact problem by introducing our product **GREN - Making Lifestyle Sustainable** <br/>
